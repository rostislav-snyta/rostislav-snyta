# Hi everyone! 👋

I enjoy working with numbers, logical reasoning, and uncovering insights in data.  Equally important to me are communication and a human-centered approach.  I enjoy learning new technologies and I am particularly fascinated by the practical possibilities that AI brings - whether at work, for personal development, or in everyday routines.  

Currently, I am primarily seeking an analytical position, while remaining open to various data-related opportunities where analytical thinking and problem-solving are valued.
